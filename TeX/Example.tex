General reply to everyone, thanks, general points followed in the reply, and the like.

The authors would like to thank the reviewers for their comments ...

We believe we have addressed all the issues raised in the following rebuttal. For each comment, we have first highlighted the issue, then we provided an answer, and finally we described how the manuscript was adjusted.

\section{}

\comment{The snarky but useless comment}

\reply{Your perfect reply here you detail all the nice things you want the referee to know and you withhold all the nasty things you really think}

\changes{Changes made in the manuscript. Overkill if you also add track changes. To add a track-changes version of the two manuscripts, run \texttt{latexdiff} on the original + revised paper. Goolge latexdiff tutorial to see how that works. Once you do that, you can copy-paste code from the file highlighting difference directly in here. For instance:

\begin{quotation}

\end{quotation}}
